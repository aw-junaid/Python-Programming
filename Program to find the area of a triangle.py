# This program finds the area of a triangle

# Accept the base and height of the triangle from the user
base = float(input("Enter the length of the base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

# Calculate the area of the triangle
area = 0.5 * base * height

# Print the result
print("The area of the triangle is:", area)
